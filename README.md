# French Typos

When typing, this plugin replaces straight apostrophes ' with typographic apostrophes ’, standard quotation marks " with French opening « or closing » quotation marks, and -- with em dashes —.

When you type Enter, y add one more Enter. I suggest using this function with [Liner plugin](https://github.com/platers/obsidian-linter), to autocorrect Markdown syntax.

From copmmand palette, you can launch **Apostrophes** to replace all the basic apostrophes in a document.

## Manual Installation
Hopefully, this plugin will make it to Obsidian's plugin gallery, until then, you can install it manually:

Download the main.js, styles.css and manifest.json files from the latest release's package.

Put the downloaded files into the /obsidian-french-typos folder.
Restart Obsidian.
