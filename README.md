# French Typos

When typing, in Live Preview, this plugin replaces straight apostrophes ' with typographic apostrophes ’, standard quotation marks " with French opening "« " or closing " »" quotation marks, and "-- " with em dashes "—".

When you type Enter, two Enters appear. I suggest using this function with [Linter plugin](https://github.com/platers/obsidian-linter), to autocorrect Markdown syntax.

From command palette, you can launch **Apostrophes** to replace all the basic apostrophes in a document.

You can highligt hardspaces like in Ulysses or Word.

On/Off buttons for all options.
